/**
    Observer design pattern will Observes all the classes and it will provides the info from one class to another.
    The best example we can take as Facebook. if we update anything in our profile, that notification can view,
    who is the friends to us. Who is unfriend for us can can't view any notification.

    In the same manner Observer Design Pattern works.
